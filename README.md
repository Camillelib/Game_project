## Concept
You are a Pokemon trainer. During an epic battle against your rival, thanks to your dear pokemon you will have to prove that you are the best. 
Choose wisely the type of your pokemon and his actions and you will be at near the master of the pokemon league.. 


### Pokemon types
A Pokemon is a creature with a lot of abilities. But the first is to fight against other pokemon.
There are, in the pokemon world, 4 types of pokemon :
- Attacker
- Defenser
- Burster
- Healer

### Action types
On each turn the trainer has to choose between 4 actions :

ATK: damages the opponent                
BURST : if the opponent ATK, this action does double damage   
DEF: cancels the opponent ATK                                         
HEAL: heals your pokemon 


## Rules
The player choose whether it's a 2 players game or against the computer.
The players choose their trainerâ€™s name then their pokemon name and the type.
The players choose the 5 next actions of their pokemon.
As long as  pokemon have life points (starting from 100 or 120 if the pokemon is a defenser type), each trainer has 5 more actions.
